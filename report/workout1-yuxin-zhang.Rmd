The dataset from IBTrACs includes tropical cyclone best track data from 2010 to 2015 in a centralized location to aid our understanding of the distribution, frequency, and intensity of tropical cyclones worldwide.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
df =read_csv("/Users/yuxinzhang/Downloads/STAT133/workout01/data/ibtracs-2010-2015.csv",
             col_names = TRUE, col_types = cols(), 
             na = c("-999.","-1.0","0.0"))
#Specify strings of missing values with "-999.", "-1.0", and "0.0".
df$Basin = as.factor(df$Basin)
df$ISO_time = as.character(df$ISO_time)
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="Wind(WMO)"]<-"Wind"
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="Pres(WMO)"]<-"Pres"
```

```{r}

tc_per_year<-summarise(
  group_by(df, Season),
  number_tc=n_distinct(Name)
)

ggplot(tc_per_year, aes(x=Season, y=number_tc))+geom_bar(stat='identity')


df['Month'] = month(df$ISO_time, label = TRUE)

tc_per_month<-summarise(
  group_by(df, Month),
  number_tc=n()
)

tc_per_month

```

Obviously, the numbers of unique storms in 2015 and 2013 are  significantly higher than the others. With respect to month, the number of unique storms is at the trough in April, begins to increase gradually and reach the peak in summer, then decreases significantly. In another word, storms are more active in Aug and Sep. 

```{r ecoh=FALSE, fig.align ='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/yuxinzhang/Downloads/STAT133/workout01/images/map-all-storms.png')
```

The map about worldwide storms shows that most storms concentrate around the equator. 
Now we move to compare storm frequency, wind and pressure in each hemisphere.
```{r}
df['hemisphere']=NA
df$hemisphere[df$Latitude >0&df$Longitude >0]="NE"
df$hemisphere[df$Latitude >0&df$Longitude <0]="NW"
df$hemisphere[df$Latitude <0&df$Longitude >0]="SE"
df$hemisphere[df$Latitude <0&df$Longitude <0]="SW"
hemi_summary<-summarise(
  group_by(na.omit(df), hemisphere),
  number_tc=n_distinct(Name),
  mean_wind=mean(Wind),
  mean_pres=mean(Pres)
)
hemi_summary
```

The summary table show that storms in NW are most frequent, while significant least frequent in SW, and average wind is the most strong in NE. On the other hand, average pressure of storms in each hemisphere do not deviate a lot. 


```{r}

basin_wind_pres<-(summarise(
  group_by(na.omit(df), Basin),
  number_tc=n_distinct(Name),
  wind=mean(Wind, na.rm = TRUE),
  pres=mean(Pres, na.rm = TRUE)
))
basin_wind_pres
```

For more details, storms are most active in WP than in the others, while the  storms in SA are least active. Additionally, we compute the average wind and pressure in each basin and find out that wind in WP is strongest, while weakes in SA. And devaition among pressure of storms are not great, concentrating around 1000, while pressure is lowest in WP. 

```{r ecoh=FALSE, fig.align ='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/yuxinzhang/Downloads/STAT133/workout01/images/map-ep-na-storms-by-year.png')
```
```{r ecoh=FALSE, fig.align ='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/yuxinzhang/Downloads/STAT133/workout01/images/map-ep-na-storms-by-month.png')
```


Focusing on EP and NA basins each year and month, storms in NA are more active in the last three years than before, while storms in EP are more active in the first three years and became less active. Storms in both region are active in later summer, Aug and Sep, and inactive in winnter, Dec and Jan.
